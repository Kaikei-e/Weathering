# Weathering
Weathering your mood: Flow, Adapt, Overcome.


This tool is inspired by cognitive behavioral chair work and other methods, but is intended for personal use, is used at your own risk, and the author treats it as a support wheel and therefore takes no risks associated with its use.
However, I am happy to help people, so again, please do so at your own risk. It is always best to consult your physician.
