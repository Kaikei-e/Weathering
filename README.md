# Weathering
Weathering your mood: Flow, Adapt, Overcome.


This tool is inspired by cognitive behavioral chair work and other methods, but is intended for personal use, is used at your own risk, and the author treats it as a support wheel and therefore takes no risks associated with its use. It's published with the hope that it may provide some assistance to those who are struggling with the same hardships and agonies as I do. I would be very pleased if you could use it while consulting a specialist.
